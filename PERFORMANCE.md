## Implemented with dynamic programming

Showed slower runtimes -- due to last-level cache misses and register LOAD times
preventing hitting high instructions per cycle. Given that each individual unit of
work is expected to be considerably cheap, DP is likely a bad fit for this problem.
Knew that going in, but worth testing. Workloads that took ~294 seconds w/o DP were
taking ~330 seconds with DP. Clearly we saved ourselves some work, but not much.

Reducing the search space as cleverly as possible will be the best efficiency improvement.
As for performance, we just need to pipeline as fast as possible. Probably do some loop
unrolling and reduce unnecessary copies and intermediate results is the best.

## Removed unnecessary intermediate BigUint in fold accumulator

Also used u8 instead of u32 where possible to pack more bits into the cache lines.

Got ~2x speedup.
